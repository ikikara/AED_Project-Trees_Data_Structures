## Description:
This was the 1st project developed for Data Structures and Algorithms subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering <br>
Consists in develop a program that make a study about time complexity (O(n)) of some operations of tree data structures like Merkle Tree, AVL Tree and Splay Tree.

#### Main Languages:

## Technologies used:
1. Python
    - [Version 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

## To run this project:
[WARNING] Python 3.9  must be installed <br>
You have one way to run this project:
1. Using Terminal
    - Download the files in src folder (that you want to run: 1, 2 or 3)
    - Finally just run it 
        ```shellscript
        [your-disk]:[name-path]> python main.py
        ```

## Notes important to read:
   - In this repository folders 1, 2 and 3 are respective to different type of tree structure. The way to run them it's the same
   - This programs will only print the time it took to run for a certain "n" that will be requested as input
   - Inside the code you can make changes to test the structure for different cases
   - Folder tests have some tests used when writing code 
   - For more information about this exercises consult the Statement
