# Merkle Tree

A Merkle Tree or Hash Tree is a structure widely used in cryptography in which each leaf of the tree is annotated with the hash code referring to a block of data.
Internal nodes are annotated with the hash code of their children.<br>
This tree serves to make a secure verification of the contents of extensive data structures. 
Let's also assume that the Hash Tree is formed from a complete binary tree.<br><br>
